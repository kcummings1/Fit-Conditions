Project Title
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is called Fit Conditions. Created for users that are fitness and outdoor enthusiasts. Sometimes we want to workout or go for a run outside but can't predict the weather, We're hoping this will help. 

Motivation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As a group we came up with this idea because each one of us feels that being active and healthy is important and to help encourage that we designed this app. We wanted to bring the "what will the weather be later?" or "I plan on going for a run after work, but the weather might have other plans", concept to fruition. Simply where users can just open our app on their phone, tablet or laptop and get the information they need about weather and suggested workouts, runs or hikes.
